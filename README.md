# finalproject
In the sequence 0.0.0, you can replace each value with a variable. X.Y.Z

Each variable has a different meaning:

X is the highest ranking value. It represents the number of features in a project.
Y is second, therefore it is each minor change.
Z is last, it represents the smallest possible change and most likely will not be used.
